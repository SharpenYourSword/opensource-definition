        “Open Source Software” means any software or software component or technology
        that is subject to an open source license. Open source licenses are generally
        licenses that make source code available for free modification and distribution,
        but can also apply to technology received and distributed solely in object code form.
        Examples of open source licenses include:
        (a) GNU's General Public License (GPL) or Lesser/Library GPL (LGPL);
        (b) the OpenSSL License; (c) the Mozilla Public License;
        (d) the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) License; and (e) the Apache License.
