        Open Source Licenses
        A. An Open Source License is a licensing arrangement which, in the exclusive judgment of Perforce, constitutes an open source license.
        B. Perforce considers the following licensing agreements to be Open Source Licenses:
                1. The GNU general public license, version 2
                2. The GNU lesser general public license, version 2.1
                3. The GNU library public license
                4. A license consisting exclusively of the following language, verbatim: “Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted.”
        C. No licensing arrangement other than the ones enumerated in the previous paragraph constitutes an Open Source License unless Perforce provides Customer with written notice that the licensing arrangement, in Perforce’s judgment, constitutes an Open Source License.
