Legal definitions of Open Source Software
=========================================

What is *Open Source* ?

There is the common need of having to define
what "Open Source Software" is.
The most common example is in legal documents
(software licenses, legal agreements, etc.)
or documents describing sofwtare
(documentation, RFPs, etc.)

A common answer is
"code that is under a license conforming
with the Open Source Definition,
as published by the Open Source Initiative".

On the
`Open Source Initiative website <https://opensource.org/>`_
one can read the 
`Open Source Definition <https://opensource.org/osd>`_,
as well as an
`annotated version <https://opensource.org/osd-annotated>`_.

Unfortunately, this indirect definition
is not always convenient for legal documents.
It should be noted that a *lot* of EULAs
make reference to "Open Source software"
without providing any definition.

This repository collects different defintions
of "Open Source Software" as found in various legal documents.


Contributions welcome!

If you have found a defintition
of "Open Source Software"
in a legal document,
I'd be happy to include it in the collection.

If you don't want to go to the trouble
of preparing and submitting a pull request,
you can simply
`open an issue <https://github.com/zvr/opensource-definition/issues/new>`_.
and provide the link to the document.
I'll integrate as soon as possible.

Thank you!
